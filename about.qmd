## Data Availability

All the processed data can be accessed on the ImmunoFusion website. We collected ICB-related cancer data sets with tumor gene expression profiles from the dbGaP, EGA, EMBL-EBI and GSA databases. Following the accession instruction described in published ICB studies (table on the "Cohort" page), we downloaded ICB patients' RNA-Seq raw sequencing data, clinical information, and response outcome information from ICB studies (if available). Curated fusion gene identification results are not available at present.

## Citation

The database is currently under submission for publication.
