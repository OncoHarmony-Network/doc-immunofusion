    "text": "We employed two Gene Fusions(GFs) detection tools, including arriba, STAR-Fusion, to identify, parse, and annotate GFs junctions within each sample, using the human genome version hg38 as the reference. In our pursuit of biologically robust GFs identification within each cohort, we undertook an approach metafusion that amalgamated results from two GFs detection tools. Firstly, we exclusively retained Fusions located on chromosomes 1 to 22, as well as the X and Y chromosomes. Secondly, GFs were mandated to exhibit genomic overlap with gene regions as defined in the reference genome annotation file, specifically “gencode.v34.annotation.gtf.”. Thirdly to ensure the precision and recall in GFs prediction with different tools, one can either rely on consensus predictions or all predctions and choosing junction-crossing reads and reads mates which flank (span) the breakpoint. Fourthly, we offer FusionAnnotator to identify and prioritize GFs that have been previously reported in cancer or normal samples. Lastly, the detected data can be divided into Cis-SAGes and other categories to further explore the debate on what should be considered true fusion RNAs. This meticulous methodological approach was instrumental in ensuring the acquisition of biologically sound and reliable GFs datasets, thereby fortifying the integrity of our analysis within each cohort. This analysis facilitated comparisons between patient groups, such as those who responded to checkpoint immunotherapy versus non-responders, as well as between samples collected before and during ICB treatment."
