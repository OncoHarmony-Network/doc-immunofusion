    "text": "We employed two Gene Fusions(GFs) detection tools, including arriba, STAR-Fusion, to identify, parse, and annotate GFs junctions within each sample, using the human genome version hg38 as the reference. In our pursuit of biologically robust GFs identification within each cohort, we undertook an approach metafusion that amalgamated results from two GFs detection tools. Firstly, we exclusively retained Fusions located on chromosomes 1 to 22, as well as the X and Y chromosomes. Secondly, GFs were mandated to exhibit genomic overlap with gene regions as defined in the reference genome annotation file, specifically “gencode.v34.annotation.gtf.”. Thirdly to ensure the precision and recall in GFs prediction with different tools, one can either rely on consensus predictions or all predctions and choosing junction-crossing reads and reads mates which flank (span) the breakpoint. Fourthly, we offer FusionAnnotator to identify and prioritize GFs that have been previously reported in cancer or normal samples. Lastly, the detected data can be divided into Cis-SAGes and other categories to further explore the debate on what should be considered true fusion RNAs. This meticulous methodological approach was instrumental in ensuring the acquisition of biologically sound and reliable GFs datasets, thereby fortifying the integrity of our analysis within each cohort. This analysis facilitated comparisons between patient groups, such as those who responded to checkpoint immunotherapy versus non-responders, as well as between samples collected before and during ICB treatment."

However, due to inconsistencies among these cohorts, such as the usage of different terms like CR, PR, SD, PD, R, NR, DCB, and NDB, we harmonized the response variable based on the timing of treatment and treatment response. As a result, we introduced a new variable called ‘Response2’ with four distinct categories: Pre-R, Pre-NR, On-R, and On-NR. In cases where response data was not available, we assigned the category NE."

However, only one aliquot may be ingested into Firehose. Therefore, a set of precedence rules are applied to select the most scientifically advantageous one among them. Two filters are applied to achieve this aim: an Analyte Replicate Filter and a Sort Replicate Filter.\n### \n### Analyte Replicate Filter\n### The following precedence rules are applied when the aliquots have differing analytes. For RNA aliquots, T analytes are dropped in preference to H and R analytes, since T is the inferior extraction protocol. If H and R are encountered, H is the chosen analyte. This is somewhat arbitrary and subject to change, since it is not clear at present whether H or R is the better protocol. If there are multiple aliquots associated with the chosen RNA analyte, the aliquot with the later plate number is chosen. For DNA aliquots, D analytes (native DNA) are preferred over G, W, or X (whole-genome amplified) analytes, unless the G, W, or X analyte sample has a higher plate number.\n### \n### Sort Replicate Filter\n### The following precedence rules are applied when the analyte filter still produces more than one sample. The sort filter chooses the aliquot with the highest lexicographical sort value, to ensure that the barcode with the highest portion and/or plate number is selected when all other barcode fields are identical.\n### \n### Ref Link: &lt;https://confluence.broadinstitute.org/display/GDAC/FAQ#FAQ-sampleTypesQWhatTCGAsampletypesareFirehosepipelinesexecutedupon&gt;\n###           &lt;https://gist.github.com/ShixiangWang/33b2f9b49b77eaa8f773b428480f9101&gt;\nTARGET_TME_after_replicate &lt;- TARGET_TME_pretreatment |&gt;\n                              mutate(\n                              prefixes = str_remove(ID, \"-[^-]+$\"),  \n                              suffixes = str_extract(ID, \"[^-]+$\"), \n                              second_chars = str_extract(suffixes, \"[0-9]+\"),\n                              second_chars = as.integer(second_chars)) |&gt;\n                              group_by(prefixes) |&gt;\n                              slice(which.max(second_chars)) |&gt;\n                              ungroup() |&gt;\n                              mutate(ID = prefixes) |&gt;

However, only one aliquot may be ingested into Firehose. Therefore, a set of precedence rules are applied to select the most scientifically advantageous one among them. Two filters are applied to achieve this aim: an Analyte Replicate Filter and a Sort Replicate Filter.\n### \n### Analyte Replicate Filter\n### The following precedence rules are applied when the aliquots have differing analytes. For RNA aliquots, T analytes are dropped in preference to H and R analytes, since T is the inferior extraction protocol. If H and R are encountered, H is the chosen analyte. This is somewhat arbitrary and subject to change, since it is not clear at present whether H or R is the better protocol. If there are multiple aliquots associated with the chosen RNA analyte, the aliquot with the later plate number is chosen. For DNA aliquots, D analytes (native DNA) are preferred over G, W, or X (whole-genome amplified) analytes, unless the G, W, or X analyte sample has a higher plate number.\n### \n### Sort Replicate Filter\n### The following precedence rules are applied when the analyte filter still produces more than one sample. The sort filter chooses the aliquot with the highest lexicographical sort value, to ensure that the barcode with the highest portion and/or plate number is selected when all other barcode fields are identical.\n### \n### Ref Link: &lt;https://confluence.broadinstitute.org/display/GDAC/FAQ#FAQ-sampleTypesQWhatTCGAsampletypesareFirehosepipelinesexecutedupon&gt;\n###           &lt;https://gist.github.com/ShixiangWang/33b2f9b49b77eaa8f773b428480f9101&gt;\n\n\nresult_data &lt;- combined_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    prefixes = str_split(ID, \"-\", simplify = TRUE)[, 1:4] %&gt;% apply(1, paste, collapse = \"-\"),\n    suffixes = str_split(ID, \"-\", simplify = TRUE)[, 5],\n    second_chars = str_extract(suffixes, \"[0-9]+\"),\n    second_chars = as.integer(second_chars))\nresult_IOBR &lt;- result_data  |&gt;\n  group_by(prefixes) |&gt;\n  slice(which.max(second_chars)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(cohort = Project_id,\n         ID = substr(prefixes, 1, 15),\n         cohort = case_when(ID %in% NORMAL_id ~ \"TCGA-NORMAL\",\n                            TRUE ~ cohort)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(ID %in% detected_id_TCGA)  |&gt; \n  select(-c(\"suffixes\", \"second_chars\",\"prefixes\")) |&gt;\n  unique() \n\ncohorts_IOBR &lt;- unique(result_IOBR$cohort)\n\nfor (cohort1 in cohorts_IOBR) {\n  cohort_data &lt;- subset(result_IOBR, cohort == cohort1) |&gt; select(-c(cohort,Project_id) )\n  file_name &lt;- paste0(\"/home/data2/Projects/Fusion/fusiondb_v3/IOBR/\", cohort1 ,\"_IOBR_signature.tsv.gz\")\n  write.table(cohort_data, \n              file = gzfile(file_name), \n              sep = \"\\t\", \n              row.names = FALSE, \n              quote = FALSE) \n}  \n\n## TME\n\nfolder_path &lt;- \"/home/data2/Projects/Fusion/fusiondb/IOBR\"\nfile_pattern &lt;- \"^TCGA.*_TME.tsv.gz$\"\nfile_list &lt;- list.files(path = folder_path, pattern = file_pattern, full.names = TRUE)\n\ncombined_data1 &lt;- data.table()\n\nfor (file in file_list) {\n\n  file_data &lt;- fread(file, sep = \"\\t\")\n  \n  file_name &lt;- basename(file)  \n  project_id &lt;- sub(\"^(TCGA-[^_]+).*\", \"\\\\1\", file_name)  \n  \n  file_data &lt;- file_data %&gt;%\n    mutate(Project_id = project_id)\n  \n  combined_data1 &lt;- rbind(combined_data1, file_data)\n}\n\nresult_data1 &lt;- combined_data1 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    prefixes = str_split(ID, \"-\", simplify = TRUE)[, 1:4] %&gt;% apply(1, paste, collapse = \"-\"),\n    suffixes = str_split(ID, \"-\", simplify = TRUE)[, 5],\n    second_chars = str_extract(suffixes, \"[0-9]+\"),\n    second_chars = as.integer(second_chars))\nresult_TME &lt;- result_data1  |&gt;\n  group_by(prefixes) |&gt;\n  slice(which.max(second_chars)) |&gt;\n    ungroup() |&gt;\n      mutate(cohort = Project_id,\n             ID = substr(prefixes, 1, 15),\n             cohort = case_when(ID %in% NORMAL_id ~ \"TCGA-NORMAL\",\n                                TRUE ~ cohort)\n      ) |&gt;\n      filter(ID %in% detected_id_TCGA)  |&gt; \n      select(-c(\"suffixes\", \"second_chars\",\"prefixes\")) |&gt;\n      unique() \n\ncohorts_TME &lt;- unique(result_TME$cohort)\n\nfor (cohort1 in cohorts_TME) {\n  cohort_data &lt;- subset(result_TME, cohort == cohort1) |&gt; select(-c(cohort,Project_id) )\n  file_name &lt;- paste0(\"/home/data2/Projects/Fusion/fusiondb_v3/IOBR/\", cohort1 ,\"_TME.tsv.gz\")\n  write.table(cohort_data, \n              file = gzfile(file_name), \n              sep = \"\\t\", \n              row.names = FALSE, \n              quote = FALSE) \n}"
